## Project Goals
The project aims to introduce and explore the world of agile coaching through an interactive experience. It begins with a presentation of the team and includes practical examples to illustrate key concepts. A core objective is to clarify the distinction between the roles of an agile coach and a scrum master, helping participants understand their contributions within agile environments. The project incorporates an interactive element (quizzes) to increase user satisfaction with the experience. Additionally, a dedicated chatbot will be developed to support users in learning about agile coaching, offering guidance, answering questions, and reinforcing core principles in a conversational way.

## Vision and general requirements
The vision of this project is to create an interactive and educational website that helps users understand the principles and practices of agile coaching. By combining informative content with playful learning tools, the project aims to demystify the role of the agile coach, highlight its differences from the scrum master, and foster a deeper appreciation for agile methodologies in real-world contexts.
